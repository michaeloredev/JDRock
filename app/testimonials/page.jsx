            It took me a while to find a reliable source in the Frederick
            Maryland area to do home repairs but when I did, Chris Ore was the
            guy. His work is very professional and when he is finished, the area
            being repaired looks better than it previously did before it was
            damaged. Chris is a very versatile person that can repair just about
            anything so if there is something you may need repaired, no matter
            what it is, don't hesitate to ask him if it's something that can be
            done. I definitely recommend him for any home repair you may need
            and even with me living out of town now, I'll still definitely use
            him if I can for any home repairs needed.

            I highly recommend Jon of JD Rock Home Improvements. He and his guys
            can do everything from basic home repair, to painting, to building
            an entire addition - and I know a couple of realtors who use him and
            LOVE him.

            My husband and I were very apprehensive about having someone work on
            our older home, which needed all new windows. But, we were so
            pleased with the quality of Jon's work that we are contracting with
            him again to remodel a bathroom. From our very first conversations
            with Jon - we were impressed with his expertise and his professional
            and thorough nature. Jon took time to answer our many questions and
            always responded quickly to phone and email messages. Jon's crew
            left an extremely clean work site every evening (this was important
            to use since we have a young child) and completed high quality work.
            We can't wait to work with him again!

            J.D. Rock was a pleasure to work with. Not only did they complete my
            repair quickly, they provided an innovative solution to prevent
            future problems. This type of proactive approach made me feel like I
            was dealing with more than just another contractor trying to make a
            buck- these are quality craftsmen who truly care about their
            customers and take pride in their work. I highly recommend J.D. Rock
            and plan to use them again and again!

            I just wanted to take this opportunity to extend a heartfelt thank
            you for the wonderful and extremely professional job you did on
            transforming my condo into the ideal living environment by removing
            my old carpet and vinyl and installing laminate flooring in my
            kitchen, living room, sun room, foyer and guest bathroom. Many, many
            thanks to you and your team of highly skilled craftsmen!! It has
            been less than a month since I had the flooring installed, and
            already, I have had at least several dozen people visit my new
            living quarters and praise the quality of the workmanship. I never
            would have imagined that the end product would turn out as beautiful
            as it has… not to mention the massive accolades I have begun to
            receive from family, friends and coworkers and even furniture
            delivery men! I also appreciate your flexibility, honesty and
            dedicated work ethic to get the job done correctly. Your attention
            to detail and the strong strive for perfection is well appreciated
            and welcomed from someone who also strives for perfection. Please
            keep in mind that I am more than happy to provide any future
            references to prospective clients in need of upcoming home
            improvements. Additionally, I can't wait for the possibility next
            spring for you to consider another home improvement project within
            my home, pending the condo association's approval. In the meantime,
            I will happily pass your name along to others who are also looking
            to improve the quality of their home.

            My wife and I were introduced to Jon by a neighbor about a year ago
            and when we were looking for a contractor to build out the
            unimproved first floor of our new home. Jon came with good
            references, including glowing comments from our neighbor. We
            couldn't have been happier with our association with Jon and his
            crews. The contract that we negotiated with him was followed to the
            letter, both in specifications and timeline. Work included creating
            a large general game/play room, a hot tub room, a full bathroom and
            tow semi-finished storage/furnace/work rooms. There were numerous
            inspections by local inspectors that Jon successfully passed with
            very few comments. Any additional requirements by inspectors were
            quickly addressed and remedied. We were particularly impressed with
            the preparation of the walls so that once Jon's crews finished
            painting, there were no imperfections with the walls being
            completely smooth. We asked Jon to return and paint the remaining
            two floors of our home. Once again, there were no surprises or
            deviation from the contract specifications. He followed precisely
            the color scheme of our interior decorator and completed the job in
            the proposed amount of time. We were particularly gratified with Jon
            when he discovered a slight deviation in color between two batches
            of paint that was very subtle; however, he insisted that his crew
            repaint an entire wall (the largest wall in the house) so there
            would be précised agreement is color throughout. We had the option
            of having all this work done by the builder of out home: however, we
            estimated that having Jon complete the work instead saved us at
            least $15,000. Additionally, his workmanship was superb and we're
            certain that his high quality work could not have been matched by
            the builder.
